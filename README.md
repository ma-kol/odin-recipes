# odin-recipes
The current project is the Recipes Project. It involves making an index.html page as the home page, then adding 2 more recipes with links that lead to those pages.

Completing this project shows that I am able to navigate the terminal on Linux as well as Visual Studio Code to formulate a web page. It also gives me practice using Git and GitHub.

Reflection: 
I had a fun time completing this project. I enjoy the front-end web page development material. I did get stuck at one point, but figured it out. My paths for the external links were not directly linked, so the web pages for the other recipes were not showing up. This was fixed once I properly linked the pathways.
